Hi Bro :) Welcome to My Wordpress-Workflow. My Name is **Harish** I'm the Creator of this Front-End Workflow..

#Overview
This Workflow is Based on **Gulp Task** that can make your Jade, Sass, Javascript ect...Files Compiler Fast as cool...

#The Main Feature

- Easy to Use :)

With Jade you can write your PHP / HTML5. Sass is for CSS3 anyway. The Sprite is use for Icons mostly. Livereload is for CSS, edits and image changes apply live to your Website. And now Finally about Optimazion it will compressed / Minify all Html, Php, Css & Images files. so your Site can render fast as Light :)

#Extra Feature
Google Material Design is one of the thing i try to add in this Workflow so far. The Material Design Sass Files are added in $Dev/Styles/Material_Design/ path, So you can Import that into your sass file to do Awsome Design for Website.

#Workflow
Now Comes to your Wordpress Theme Workflow, you are going to Spend the most of the Time in $Dev folder. What Every you do in $dev folder, it will copy to Main Folder Where Wordpress can apply your design to your Website :).
Note: Just Remember to do not Edit or Delete the outside of $Dev Folder. If you do So may or Maynot this Wordflow will Stop Working.
